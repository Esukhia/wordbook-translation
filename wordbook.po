msgid ""
msgstr "SOME THINGS YOU'LL NEED TO KNOWÂ "

msgid ""
msgstr "MORE ON WORDS AND LANGUAGEÂ Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Unusual Words"

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"To introduce words not in the child's standard vocabularyâ€”foreign words, "
"for exampleâ€”if it is possible, give the definition first, then the word. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"It is also common practice to underline the word the first time it is used. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Readers of any age tend to skip over unfamiliar words without trying to read"
" them, getting the meaning from the context of the sentence. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Giving the definition first makes it much easier to actually learn the new "
"word.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Names."

msgid ""
msgstr "Nicknames for your characters can be highly desirable. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They can help describe someone's personality or appearance with little or no"
" exposition: \"Hey, Red, come here!\" \"Go get Pokey so we can get "
"started.\" "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They can also set the mood as hostile or friendly or describe the cultural "
"set of an era or a nation. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They are also excellent \"tags\" that help your reader remember or identify "
"a character. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Unless it is important to the story, avoid connecting words like tiny, "
"little, bitty, and small to the names of your protagonists. "

msgid ""
msgstr "The tiny of Tiny Tim is central to the character and his problem. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Believe me, Little Leroy and Bitsy Betty have problems, too, whether you "
"intended them or not. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Psychologically, the diminutive name takes away personal power and "
"emasculates. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Even names like Jimmy or Billy fall into this cabinet."

msgid ""
msgstr " Nonsexist and Nonracist Terminology."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"It is good to use generic terminology instead of words that express gender "
"bias. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"For example, use mail carrier instead of mailman, and carry that principle "
"to all occupations or positions that end with man. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Other things to look out for are usage of the pronoun he. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Even though it is proper to use the masculine pronoun, try to vary it. "

msgid ""
msgstr "You can also use the plural they or the neutral third person you. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Both are widely used today to avoid more awkward constructions such as "
"he/she. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Another area to avoid in nonsexist writing is stereotypical roles, such as "
"exclusively male doctors and exclusively female nurses in a hospital "
"setting. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Women and men should be treated the same in all types of stories, as should "
"boys and girls. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Again, stay away from stereotyping."

msgid ""
msgstr " Diversity."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Race, religion, and physical abilities are other areas where you should be "
"sensitive to word usage. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Use African American or of African heritage instead of black, and Native "
"American instead of Indian. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Asian American is preferable to Oriental; not all Muslims are Arabs; not all"
" Arabs are Muslim; Hispanics are from the Americas, while Latinos are from "
"any place that speaks Spanish. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"You get the idea; be sensitive, especially to offensive terminology, and "
"seek out an authority when in doubt. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Children enjoy reading about people like themselves, so it's good to have "
"characters with diverse backgrounds. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"As noted in the introduction, ethnic, cultural pride, and bilingual books, "
"as well as books with disabled characters, have increased in number though "
"they do not yet constitute a large percentage of the publishing world for "
"juvenile readers. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"With the tremendous strides the world has taken toward globalization, "
"diversity has become an important part of juvenile literature, and I expect "
"this to grow dramatically in the next few years. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Tags. "

msgid ""
msgstr "An editor may suggest you use a tag to help identify a character. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Tags are actions or gestures a character typically uses that easily identify"
" the person to the reader. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"A boy may toss his head when he gossips, a young girl may push up her "
"glasses just before she throws a fast pitch. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The tag may be used to build a character, be part of the problem, or "
"identify a \"mystery\" person. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"For example, a boy may try to hide in the bushes or shadow a suspect while "
"humming the song he always hums or sniffing a chronically runny nose. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"As noted before, nicknames are another good tag you can use to help describe"
" a character."

msgid ""
msgstr "THEME AND CONTENTÂ Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Character's Ages."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The protagonist(s) of your story should be the same age as or a little older"
" than the reader. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Establish the age of the protagonist as soon as possible, and make sure your"
" characters act appropriately for their ages."

msgid ""
msgstr " Taboos."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"While the market is much more flexible than in the past, stay away from any "
"positive portrayal of drugs, tobacco, alcohol, explicit sex, crime, and "
"violence. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Drunkenness particularly should never be portrayed in a humorous light. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"You will find certain themes, while not actually taboo, difficult to sell. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Animals that talk to people are almost impossible to sellâ€”even as fantasy."
" "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"'Lil Toot and The Little Engine That Could aside, anthropomorphizing "
"inanimate objects also makes for a difficult sale. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Stories that turn out to be only a dream are not often welcome, especially "
"if waking up is used to solve a plot problem. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Things that are too cute, too old-fashioned, or too common usually get the "
"cold shoulder, too.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr "One of those not-taboo-but subjects is weight. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"There is currently a medical, political, and social focus on overweight "
"children and youth that promises to have a very real impact on our culture. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"At the same time, eating disorders are a very real issue, especially with "
"preteens and early teens. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"As a result, the subject of weight should be handled carefullyâ€”especially "
"if it is not the focus of the story or book you are writing."

msgid ""
msgstr " Fantasy and Fairy Stories."

msgid ""
msgstr "Fantasy is a healthy field for juvenile publishing. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"However, retelling such classics as Thumbelina or The Goose Girl in modern "
"dress is sure to garner rejection slips instead of praise. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If you are tempted to begin your story \"Once upon a time,\" you should "
"probably think about how it will fit in your target publisher's list."

msgid ""
msgstr " Mystery."

msgid ""
msgstr "There is a great difference between adult and children's mysteries. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Violence is generally out for any age group. "

msgid ""
msgstr "For preteen readers, murder is out, and so are most dead bodies. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The only corpses are generally ancient mummies that lend a creepy mood to a "
"story. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Missing treasure, old legends and secrets, theft, and even kidnapping have "
"formed the core of wonderful juvenile mysteries. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Many mystery books are elaborate puzzles the reader is meant to solve.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Science Fiction."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Science fiction becomes popular around fourth or fifth grade when it is a "
"venue for fast-paced adventure. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"With science making headlines daily and subjects such as space and ecology "
"entering the standard curriculum by second or third grade, science fiction "
"stories may well find a home in even younger markets. "

msgid ""
msgstr "By the sixth grade, character development becomes important. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Science fiction is often a pleasant and charming way of explaining science "
"or giving facts, but make sure its primary goal is to entertain."

msgid ""
msgstr " Romance."

msgid ""
msgstr "Romance stories are popular with sixth graders on up. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Contemporary stories often include urban themes such as gangs, alcohol, and "
"sex. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Today's teens are dealing with some serious situations, and books and "
"stories that accurately reflect their world are popular. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Nonfiction. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Nonfiction is popular with readers in the elementary level, and stories in "
"trade books and magazines are often used in the classroom. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Stories about scientific phenomena, the environment, history, and technology"
" interest every age group but the very youngest. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Current events and how-to books are welcome at the elementary and high "
"school level. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Problem-Oriented Stories. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Issues such as divorce and death (usually the death of a pet) are now being "
"introduced in the first three years instead of, as when this book was first "
"published, the fifth or sixth grade. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"These issues must be handled carefully, but they open up new markets for "
"stories that deal with the modern child's reality."

msgid ""
msgstr "AGE GROUPS AND READING LEVELSÂ "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"This section covers the age groupings and categories of books that "
"publishers recognize. "

msgid ""
msgstr "First, let's discuss the age groups.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Level Books."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Many books are now indicated by levels rather than by specific grades. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"For example, Level 1 is generally used for kindergarten through second "
"grade. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"This three-grade spread recognizes that there is a wide range of normal "
"abilities among students. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The vocabulary used for the level is the middle one, in this case, first "
"grade. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Many children are ahead or behind the usual target vocabularies for grade "
"and age, and level books allow the students to use materials that are "
"appropriate for them without some of the social issues involved with reading"
" material identified as being for a grade different from the one the student"
" is in."

msgid ""
msgstr " Preschool to Kindergarten."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Preschool books that are self-readers constitute a much larger market than "
"in the past. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Early childhood education is a major focus of both state and national "
"educational programs, and reading is a primary focus. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Picture books and picture stories are the primary forms for school and home."
" "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"As a result, the story that is meant to be read by a caregiver to the child,"
" and is not appropriate as a self-reader as well, has become less common. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"While the most common sentence length for self-readers at this level is "
"still about six words, some publishers now use longer sentences (up to "
"fifteen words) for even these youngest readers. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"To do this, they break the sentences into smaller phrases that generally "
"express a whole idea like the writing sample in the kindergarten section:"

msgid ""
msgstr "He ran after the kittenÂ "

msgid ""
msgstr "when it came into the room.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " The Primary Age Group."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"This group, which includes children from six- to eight-years-old, or first "
"through third grades, reads the picture book, picture story, and easy-to-"
"read book. "

msgid ""
msgstr "More magazines are aimed at this age group than at younger children. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The easy reader is meant for the child to read alone, and the target "
"sentence length is five to six words, ten words maximum. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"All the words given in the kindergarten through third-grade word lists are "
"appropriate to use when writing for this group. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"There is some movement toward taking the chapter book concept, in very short"
" chapters, to grades one and two rather than waiting until level three or "
"third grade, as is most common."

msgid ""
msgstr " The Elementary Level."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Traditionally this has included the eight- to twelve-year-olds, or the "
"fourth through sixth graders. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"More and more often this now is used to identify third through fifth grade, "
"or seven- through ten- or eleven-year olds. "

msgid ""
msgstr "The target sentence length here is ten words. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The longest length acceptable to conservative institutions is about twenty "
"words. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Sentence length is more flexible in books than in magazines. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Fiction should have a lot of action, and both fiction and nonfiction should "
"deal with the special interests and problems relevant to this age group. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Most books written for this age group range between 20,000 and 40,000 words."
" "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Most magazines use stories ranging from 700 to 2,000 words and often have a "
"page or two of short-shorts under 100 words."

msgid ""
msgstr " Middle School Through High School."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Middle school, a new addition to this book, includes the sixth through "
"eighth grades. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The two groups, middle school and high school, include twelve- to eighteen-"
"year-olds. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Sixth graders, or twelve-year-olds, always constituted a major portion of "
"the readership. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"This is the time when reading problems often become serious problems. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Hi-lo books (for high interest, low reading level) and other materials meant"
" to help the student catch up to grade level are introduced here. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Regular texts that are not in the hi-lo grouping use an adult vocabulary and"
" sentence structure. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Most books range from 25,000 to 55,000 words, and longer lengths are "
"permissible. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Popular fiction subjects include romance, mystery, suspense (mild horror), "
"the supernatural, and humor. "

msgid ""
msgstr "More magazines are aimed at this age group than at any other. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Magazine stories range from 1,000 to 3,500 words. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Eighty percent of this market is nonfiction and include age-related "
"problems, interviews, and special interests."

msgid ""
msgstr "WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS IT?"

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The terms that follow are commonly used by publishers to describe the "
"different types of children's books.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Picture Books."

msgid ""
msgstr "There are basically three types of picture books. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The first type of picture book is for babies to three-year-olds, has little "
"text, and is often prepared by publishers in-house. "

msgid ""
msgstr "The next type is for toddlers to five-year-olds. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The picture books must be kept short enough to be read aloud by an adult to "
"a child at one sitting. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They should have a happy ending and must use language that can be read aloud"
" comfortably. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Sentence length should also be determined by reading ease. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If the book is meant to be an early self-reader, the target sentence length "
"should be five to six words, and each page should lend itself to "
"illustration that will help carry the story. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Try to use mainly kindergarten and first-grade vocabulary. "

msgid ""
msgstr "These books should take no more than twenty minutes to read."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The oldest group of picture book readers is for the five- to eight-year-"
"olds. "

msgid ""
msgstr "These books must have a story to tell. "

msgid ""
msgstr "They should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. "

msgid ""
msgstr "There should be a plot, but it should be simple. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Children in this age group still like to be read to, and rhythm keeps them "
"attentive. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Picture books may run from as few as 50 words to 1,500. Most picture books "
"average 500 to 1,000 words. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Books for the youngest listeners (through five years old) should take no "
"more than twenty minutes to read; ten to fifteen minutes is preferred. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Keep in mind the short attention span of the listener.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Picture Story."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Picture stories are the picture books in which text carries the story. "

msgid ""
msgstr "These are for the five- to eight-year-old. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Picture stories tell a real story and have lots of action. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If it is written for an adult to read to a child, sentence length is "
"restricted only to that which is comfortable to read aloud, and the "
"vocabulary should be such that the child can understand it, rather than read"
" it. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The picture story is still heavily illustrated but has a more complicated "
"plot than a picture book."

msgid ""
msgstr "Easy-to-Read Books (also known as young readers). "

msgid ""
msgstr "These books are intended for ages six to nine (grades one to three). "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Manuscripts are 500 to 2,000 words, with 1,000 to 1,500 words preferred. "

msgid ""
msgstr "These books generally have about forty pages of text. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Sentences should be five to six words in length, with a few up to eight "
"words. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"When putting your story together, try not to break up phrases between lines."
" "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"To make sure that you haven't done this and that your story is easy to read,"
" read it out loud a few times. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"These books are for the child to read alone; if your book is meant to be "
"read by an adult to a child, notify the publisher when you submit it."

msgid ""
msgstr " Hi-Lo Books."

msgid ""
msgstr "The term hi-lo means high interest, low reading level. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"These books are purchased mainly by schools and are written for people "
"learning to read or those who are reading behind grade level. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They use a controlled vocabulary and a sentence length appropriate to the "
"vocabulary level. "

msgid ""
msgstr "They use a lot of action and dialogue. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Romance, mystery, and heritage-based, culturally centered stories, as well "
"as stories dealing with urban problems, are often welcome. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Most of these books run from 400 to 1,200 words.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Many publishers want hi-lo books or other graded books but do not supply the"
" word lists. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"It is here that the graded word lists in this book become invaluable. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Sentence length is about ten to twelve words. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Stories should be fast paced and have a tightly knit plot. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"You can write a hi-lo book on the second-grade level, but the story must be "
"mature in theme.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Young Adult Novels."

msgid ""
msgstr "These books are written for readers aged twelve to eighteen. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They are similar to mainstream novels except the protagonist is a teen or "
"young adult, and the story is relevant to that age group."

msgid ""
msgstr "TECHNICAL ITEMS THAT HELP YOU SELLÂ Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Word Count."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"One of the most common reasons magazines reject good manuscripts is the "
"failure to include a word count at the top of the first page. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The use of computers with their varying type faces, sizes, and spacing has "
"made even standard formulas for computing word count unreliable. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"It may not matter with a one- or two-page piece, but editors are not going "
"to sit and count the number of words in your work to see if it will fit "
"their format."

msgid ""
msgstr " Standard Format."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"There are individuals at writers' conferences and some articles and books "
"that encourage you to have your manuscript stand out by using colored paper "
"or type. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Even more suggest that your manuscript should include the rights you are "
"selling at the top of the first page or that it should include a copyright "
"notice. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Virtually all these items mark the author as an amateur. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Manuscripts other than picture books should be double spaced on white paper "
"with black ink using 12-point type in a standard font. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If there is no notice of the rights being sold, the author is offering first"
" publication rights in English in North America. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Only if the author is offering something different should the subject of "
"rights be broached, and then it should be explained in the cover letter. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Copyright is automatic in the United States and many other countries as "
"well. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Picture Books. "

msgid ""
msgstr "The author needs to indicate each page of a picture book. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"In other words, the author should make it obvious what text goes with which "
"picture and that each page is separate. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The most practical way to do this is to give the line of text with three "
"dots, or other obvious page maker, below it:"

msgid ""
msgstr "The San Diego Zoo has pandasÂ Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"That way, a number of pages can be shown on a single manuscript page.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Bibliographies."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Occasionally children's periodicals ask writers to submit lists of reference"
" material to support their facts. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Do keep track of your source material; do not submit it with your story "
"until asked for it unless you know the periodical requires it. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Books are another matter; reference material should be cited with any work "
"of nonfiction or fiction."

msgid ""
msgstr "OTHER TYPES OF WRITINGÂ Â "

msgid ""
msgstr "So far this book has primarily dealt with books. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"A great many other markets are available to authors who write for children, "
"including magazines, radio and television, and the legitimate stage.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Features."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"A feature is a newspaper or magazine story that allows emotional involvement"
" or entertains as well as informs. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Such stories almost always make your audience feel something or want to do "
"something. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Feature stories really come into their own at the elementary level. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade magazines often use the feature story style"
" to lend life to science, mathematics, and news stories. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Educational inserts in daily newspapers and special educational newspapers "
"also use these kinds of stories."

msgid ""
msgstr " Fillers."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"A filler is a short article or storyâ€”usually under 500 words and often "
"under 100. Fillers, such as games, riddles, and items of special scientific "
"or human interest, are especially welcome in young children's periodicals. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"In broadcasting, fillers are short, nonessential stories kept on hand in "
"case a program runs short. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If you are helping to produce a children's television or radio news program,"
" keep a number of these on hand and at the bottom of the reader's pile. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Trivia about such things as the world's largest pizza or the biggest pair of"
" shoes is interesting and can be carried week after week until needed."

msgid ""
msgstr " Writing for Television."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The existence of public-access cable television channels and the "
"availability of reasonably priced videotaping equipment have created a "
"variety of exciting opportunities for people throughout the country. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Even the smallest schools often videotape students presenting a weekly news "
"report or original drama to be shown on these television channels or for use"
" in the classroom."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Television news and other productions that narrate silent videos the viewers"
" are watching generally use a forty- to forty-five-space line for the "
"script, typed in a double- or triple-spaced column down the right-hand side "
"of the paper. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Common margin settings are thirty for the left margin and seventy for the "
"right margin. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The placement allows the left side of the paper to be used to note what "
"video accompanies the text. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Each forty-space line takes about two seconds of on-air time to read. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Triple spacing makes it easier for the reader to keep his place and the "
"writer to edit the work.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Writing for Radio."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Many schools now have their own FM radio broadcasting facilities or access "
"to local college or commercial stations. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"It's easy to produce material for this medium according to professional "
"industry standards; and like so many other things, it's just as easy for the"
" children to learn the correct format as any other. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Standard radio broadcast format uses a sixty-five-space line for typing. "

msgid ""
msgstr "This line length makes timing your stories easy. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Each group of sixteen lines takes about one minute to read aloud. "

msgid ""
msgstr "It is assumed it takes 3.75 seconds to read each line."

msgid ""
msgstr " Writing in Verse."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Verse seems to be everywhere in children's publishing, yet it is sometimes "
"very hard to sell. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"One of the problems is that verse must sound good when read out loud, and it"
" needs to be easy to read for an extended period. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Read your work into a tape recorder, have a friend read it to you, or take "
"it to a writers' workshop. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If you stumble or have trouble reading it smoothly and easily, go back to "
"work. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"It is a lot easier to sell verse to a magazine because it is generally "
"interspersed with other types of material. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"A good track record publishing verse in magazines will make it easier to "
"sell a book written the same way."

msgid ""
msgstr " Writing Plays."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Children's plays can be written one of three ways: (1) with children as "
"actors, (2) with adults as actors and children as the audience, and (3) with"

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"National reading and comprehension standards are grouped with several "

"For a variety of reasons, ranging from multiple languages being spoken in a "
"classroom to the impact of natural disasters (which cause stress and, often,"
" interrupt education), reading comprehension testing shows that much of this"
" middle school population struggles to understand materials traditionally "
"targeted to the older elementary group.1 Thus, the learning period for "
"traditional reading skills has been expanded to include middle schools, and "
"many, if not most, reading comprehension materials and tests group middle "
"school with at least sixth grade. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"This makes read-it-yourself literature even more relevant than before. "

msgstr "There are also new subjects introduced at the earliest ages. "

msgid ""

"While actual lessons on space exploration and ecology currently wait until "

"Whether meant to be read aloud by an adult or alone by the child, the story "

msgid ""
msgstr "These stories should have lots of action.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Books meant to be read by adults to the youngest listeners should take no "

msgstr ""
"The sentence length can vary but should be such that the child that is being"

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If the sentences are long, they should have breaks and pictures to keep the "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The self-reader should have a sentence, or idea, length of five to six "
"words. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"That means that a long sentence can be broken up into shorter phrases, but "
"those phrases should convey a whole idea. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"For example, in a self reader the sentence, It is best to have two when you "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"In a related strategy, they are expected to use the subject that they are "
"reading about, picture captions, the story title, and other clues to aid "
"comprehension and make predictions about what will happen in the story or "
"what a specific character will do."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"When Word Book was first published, phonics was only one of several popular "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"As the new century takes off, phonics has returned to center stage, and "

msgid ""
msgstr " Social Changes."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Although many first graders have been in all-day kindergarten, some are new "

msgid ""
msgstr " In the Classroom."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"While children learn the seasons and the numbers one to ten in kindergarten,"

msgid ""
msgstr "Almost all sports are introduced by name at this level. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"However, the technical details and rules are not generally introduced until "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"By the end of kindergarten, most children can sound out any three- or four-"

"The suffix ing is also introduced, and words such as fishing, walking, and "

msgid ""
msgstr " Publishing."

msgid ""
msgstr "The optimal sentence length is still around five to six words. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"However, as with all writing, length should vary throughout your story. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Some publishers are now using longer sentences but use the strategy of "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The longest sentence length used in a strictly graded text for this age is "
"ten words. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Parenthetical statements should be avoided. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Sentence length is important because the early reader can become lost in the"
" individual words and have trouble understanding the overall idea. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The constraints on sentence length are eased by the ability to start "
"sentences with such words as and, because, and but. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Sentences at this level need to be whole ideas but do not necessarily need "
"to conform to strictly correct adult standards.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If the story is written for an adult to read to a child, sentence length is "

msgstr ""
"There is a great appetite for stories and nonfiction articles about "

msgid ""

"Like sports, simple mysteries and \"friendly\" ghost stories are popular "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Many, if not most, of the fiction stories published for six- to eight-year-"

msgid ""

"Two areas that are popular are stories that show a child being able to help "

msgid ""
msgstr "It was so bad even the local YMCA had to shut down.Â "

"Later in the same story is this paragraph, capitalizing on the interest of "

msgstr "Some kids had odometers on their bikes. "

"For example, about 60 percent of children in the study who had dyslexia and "

"In any event, fifth graders become more focused on the outside world than "

msgid ""

"In the past, owing to the low cost and ease of accessibility, most of the "

msgid ""

"Unimportant until recently, they include the possibility of your work being "

"The following excerpt illustrates the technique of sneaking in a history "
"lesson while actually telling a nonfiction story:"

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The tales of lost missions in Mexico are told wherever treasure hunters get "
"together. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The stories usually start off telling about gold and jewels hidden in the "
"missions. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They often end up being about the curses that are supposed to protect the "
"treasure."

msgid ""
msgstr "Most of these legends are, at best, flights of fancy. "

msgid ""
msgstr "They grew out of daydreams and years of searching. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Yet, the missions themselves are probably real. "

msgid ""
msgstr "More than that, there is some proof the curses are real, too.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr "Later in the same piece, a geography lesson is incorporated:Â "

msgid ""
msgstr "Mountains run down Mexico's west coast, and few people live there. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Even in the south, where there is lots of water, there are only a few place "

msgstr "SIXTH GRADE AND MIDDLE SCHOOLÂ Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Social Changes."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Sixth grade is now commonly combined with seventh and eighth grades, or even"
" ninth grade, to create a middle school. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Most middle school students are preteens or young teenagers whose egos "
"depend on being seen as that and not as children. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Their social life is usually centered on groups of friends rather than on "
"the family. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They have favorite rock bands, and some have their own sources of income. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Even though your reader may seem to have taken a giant step toward growing "
"up, you should stay away from any positive portrayal of drugs, tobacco, "
"alcohol, street language, explicit sex, graphic crime, or violence. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Drunkenness should not be portrayed as humorous.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Because of their own changes, the readers are usually very aware of their "
"appearance and, subsequently, how characters in stories look. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Description is not only acceptable, it's desired.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " In the Classroom."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"If they haven't already done so, most sixth-grade students are now required "
"to memorize the states, their capitals, and their major economic "
"contributions."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Overall, difficult subjects such as death and divorce are often dealt with "
"at this level in a realistic way. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Sixth grade also includes sex and health education. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"As a result, both in-school and leisure reading materials are often problem "
"oriented.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr " Publishing."

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Easy-reading books (also called hi-lo for high interest, low reading) begin "
"to appear at this level. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Most children now have a fairly sophisticated reading vocabulary, and the "
"low achiever has begun to slip between the cracks. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The easy-reading book is one way schools and other programs are trying to "
"prevent that from happening. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"These books are written to cover readers from twelve-years-old through young"
" adults, but they use a controlled vocabulary and sentence length "
"appropriate to the lower vocabulary levels. "

msgid ""
msgstr "These books are short and run from 400 to 1,200 words in length. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"They use a lot of action and dialogue, and often use sports, romance, "
"mystery, and ethnic-urban problems as subjects for their stories.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Besides being a part of the elementary eight- to twelve-year-old market, the"
" sixth grader is more and more often a real part of the high school market, "
"and others in the middle school group are firmly in its grasp. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The high school group officially targets the thirteen- to seventeen-year-"
"olds, but many readers are somewhat younger. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"This group uses an adult vocabulary (as long as it is not too sophisticated)"
" and sentence structure. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Most books range from 25,000 to 55,000 words, and longer lengths are "
"permissible. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Popular fiction subjects include romance, suspense, mild horror, the "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"More magazines are aimed at the elementary or middle school group than any "
"other. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Eighty percent of the magazine stories are nonfiction and include age-"

msgid ""
msgstr "Periodical stories usually range from 1,000 to 3,500 words.Â "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"By sixth grade, it becomes important to the reader to know exactly how a "
"character, especially a leading character, looks. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"The just-preteen reader identifies with the leading characters in the books "
"she reads, and her concerns about her own appearance are directly "
"transferred to those characters. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Others in the middle school group want to know how a character dresses, what"
" kind of makeup they wear, how they get around without mom driving, and "
"other issues that help answer very personal questions. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Do be careful when you describe your characters not to make them too much a "
"part of a popular fad either in dress or in speech. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Fads pass quickly, and your book may follow if the reader sees it as \"too "

"The following example shows the increased description present in stories for"

msgid ""
msgstr "Elizabeth thought that it was impossible not to admire him. "

msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Yet, if you looked at his features one at a time, there was little special "
"about him. "

msgid ""
msgstr "He was slim for his 5 feet 10 inches. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Besides his eyes, his gold hair and beard were his best features. "

msgid ""
msgstr "Elizabeth smiled to herself. "

msgstr "She remembered how Bob had grown that beard.Â "
